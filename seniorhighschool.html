				When I was in SHS it was a lot easier,because the way the teach student was modular.Google chrome made my school life easier back then.But I think, I really missed a lot of things that i could have done during those times. How I wish the pandemic did not happen, but there is no use in making a fuzz over sa spilled tea. Overall, life back then is very different from anything most of us have ever known, and it can occasionally be very overwhelming and stressful,especially for me in terms of academics. Online classes are by no means as entertaining as those that take place in person because they don't offer the same setting and social opportunities. But at the end of the day, I'm grateful for my current circumstances because I know that there is always something to be grateful for. I've become more stressed and the world has slowed down, but I'm slowly learning to cope.
